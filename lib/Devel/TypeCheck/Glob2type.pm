=head1 BUGS

This version is specific to Perl 5.8.1.  It may work with other
versions that have the same opcode list and structure, but this is
entirely untested.  It definitely will not work if those parameters
change.

Please report any bugs or feature requests to
C<bug-devel-typecheck at rt.cpan.org>, or through the web interface at
L<http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/ReportBug.html?Queue=Devel-TypeCheck>.
I will be notified, and then you'll automatically be notified of progress on
your bug as I make changes.
